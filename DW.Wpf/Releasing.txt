Antti 2014

Only publish release builds! Code uses debug to define for example different server address into use.

When you look into publish settings in project properties you see the publish version information.
It will be automatically incremented revision everytime you create a publish package.

Manually:
- Increment build number for bug fixes.
- Increment minor number for features.
- Increment major number for big changes.

Note, version information is not available when you debug application. Only when
application is installed from the clickonce installer.
